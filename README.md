# QuizApp 1 (React SPA with pseudo-routing)

Deployed [here, on netify](https://vvaasd-quiz-app-1.netlify.app) (Github Pages do not support dynamic sites)

Stack: React, JS, HTML, CSS.
Builder: Vite

- Used hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef, useReducer and React.memo (a bit)
- Created custom React hook useKeyDown
- Pseudo-routing (3 pages)
- Work with data (fake API)
- Responsive Pixel Perfect layout (clamp() + media queries)
- Modular CSS

App using fake loading, everything work fast without fake loading (depends on this free hosting, also the flag images are taken from the wiki - there may be a delay)

Within this project, trying to simulate real conditions, I completed technical tasks assigned to me and pushed them to remote repository (GitLab).

How to run dev mode:
- clone repository (main branch).
Terminal commands (use it in cloned repository):
- npm i
- npm run dev
