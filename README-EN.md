# QuizApp 1 (React SPA with pseudo-routing)

Country quiz app

Deployed on netify [(link to project)](https://vvaasd-quiz-app-1.netlify.app), because Github Pages don't support dynamic sites

Builder: Vite

- Used hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef, useReducer
- Created custom React hook useKeyDown
- Pseudo-routing (3 pages)
- Work with mock data to construct questions and answers for a quiz
- Responsive adaptive Pixel Perfect layout (clamp() + media queries)
- Modular CSS
- Fake loading
- Work with Git (branches, commits, pushed changes to GitLab)

The project was completed as part of the Preax internship in accordance with the technical specifications and layout.
